# Blockchain-Based E-Voting System

## Overview
This project is a blockchain-based electronic voting (e-voting) system designed to provide a secure, transparent, and efficient method for conducting elections. It leverages blockchain technology to ensure tamper-proof record-keeping and anonymity of votes.

## Features
- **Blockchain Technology**: Uses a decentralized ledger for transparent and immutable record-keeping.
- **Security**: Implements cryptographic techniques for securing votes and preventing tampering.
- **Anonymity**: Ensures voter privacy through cryptographic protocols.
- **Transparency**: Provides a transparent view of the voting process and results.

## Installation
To install and run the system locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/likitd/E-Voting-System-Using-Blockchain
   cd client
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and set your configuration variables.

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the e-voting system locally.

## Usage
1. **Administrator Setup**:
   - Initialize the blockchain network.
   - Configure the election parameters.
   - Add candidates and set up the voting process.

2. **Voter Experience**:
   - Register to vote.
   - Receive a unique identifier (token) for voting.
   - Cast votes securely and anonymously.

3. **Results**:
   - View real-time voting results.
   - Access detailed reports and analytics.

## Technologies Used
- **Blockchain**: Implement blockchain with Ethereum and Solidity
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend**: ReactJs
